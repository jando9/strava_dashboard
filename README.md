## Strava Analysis Dashboard

I wanted to calculate my own acute:chronic workload ratios for my running training and create a nice looking, interactive dashboard to visualise my data.
Still yet to finish it off and polish the presentation side of things.

Other features I am wanting to implement:
- Comparison of similar runs in distance and elevation gain
- polyline mapping of all my recent runs
